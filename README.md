# SaWP-PowerWall-RackMounted-PCB-v.1.0.0
This will be the first version made on PCB. I've made a lot of prototypes, and several is more advanced but I decided to make a working PCB to be able to test it in real.

Component	Specification
IC		LM324
R1		15K
R2		1.2K
R3, R4, R5	680 Ohms
R6		10K POT
R7		10K
R8 to R11	1K
D1		5.6V / 0.5 Watts Zener Diode
D2 to D5	LEDPreviousNext

Notes
IC LM 324 consists of 4 op amps in one package, so power supply is common and is shown once (pin 4 and 11).
To setup, connect  the circuit to battery, adjust R6 so that required voltages are available at the inverting pins (refer description to get the required voltages).
Fix the LEDâ€™s on the dash board and mark the voltages near to it as shown in circuit diagram. The gadget is now ready.
